        <h2>Hello and Welcome to my portfolio! </h2>
        <p>
          I speak Bengali. I eat all kinds of halal foods. 
          I love traveling and wish to visit as many palces as I can afford! 
        History and Religion are my favourite topic of reading. Also, I like to learn about people and culture.
        I believe we are all same, although we look different from the outside.
        We all love good food and comfort, love ourselves and our family, etc, etc...
        So, lets think big and ‚ù§Ô∏èEachOther!
